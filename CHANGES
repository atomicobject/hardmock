Hardmock 1.2.1

Sat Apr 28 00:41:30 EDT 2007

* assert_error has been broken out into its own lib file
* Gem package can now run all tests successfully
* Internal code refactoring; a number of classes that were defined in hardmock.rb are now in their own files

Hardmock 1.2.0

* You can now use "expect" in place of "expects" if you must. 
* "inspect" has been added to the list of methods NOT erased by MethodCleanout.

Hardmock 1.1.0

* "expects" replaces "expect" ("expect" now raises Hardmock::DeprecationError)
* "verify_mocks" is now implicit in teardown, you needn't call it anymore
* Mocking methods that Mock would otherwise inherit from Object (eg, to_s) is now possible
* require 'hardmock' is all that's required to use the library now; no need to include in TestCase

(previously called CMock, translated to Hardmock on 2006-12-10)
