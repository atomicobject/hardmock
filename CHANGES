Hardmock 1.0.3

* "expects" replaces "expect" ("expect" now raises Hardmock::DeprecationError)
* "verify_mocks" is now implicit in teardown, you needn't call it anymore
* Mocking methods that Mock would otherwise inherit from Object (eg, to_s) is now possible
* require 'hardmock' is all that's required to use the library now; no need to include in TestCase

(previously called CMock, translated to Hardmock on 2006-12-10)
