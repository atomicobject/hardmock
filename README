This was CMock, is now Hardmock.

CHANGES
* "expects" replaces "expect" ("expect" now raises Hardmock::DeprecationError)
* "verify_mocks" is now implicit in teardown, you needn't call it anymore
* Mocking methods that Mock would otherwise inherit from Object (eg, to_s) is now possible
* require 'hardmock' is all that's required to use the library now; no need to include in TestCase

TODO:
* Release as GEM
* Release as plugin
* Mock actual methods on actual objects or classes or modules?
* Achieve clarity on "yields"
